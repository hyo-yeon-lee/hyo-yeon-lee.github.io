I am a final-year Computer Science student at the University of Bristol, with a strong interest in the intersection of machine learning (neural networks) and linguistics. I’m currently working on [Language Evolution in Iterated Learning Models Using Variational Autoencoders and Image-Based Meaning](https://github.com/fw22912/Language-Evolution-Modelling-with-ILM), exploring how language evolves through machine learning-driven simulations for my dissertation.

Previously, I worked as a Faculty-Funded Research Assistant at the University of Bristol, where I developed automated verification software to assess the correctness of LLM-generated proof harness functions for C programs using CBMC, iterating until valid results were obtained.

I’m particularly interested in applying machine learning to understand structured communication and hope to further explore these ideas in both research and practical applications.
